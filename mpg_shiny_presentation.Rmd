# Welcome to the MPG Shiny App

A simple Shiny app to explore car fuel efficiency data (mpg dataset).  
This presentation will show how the app works and its features.

# Introduction

- The app allows users to select variables from the `mpg` dataset.  
- Users can filter by manufacturer, class, or engine size.  
- Outputs include reactive plots and summary statistics.

# User Inputs

- Dropdowns, sliders, and checkboxes for filtering data  
- Example: select `manufacturer` and `year`  
- Example: slider for `displ` (engine displacement)

# Reactive Outputs

- Plot: fuel efficiency (mpg) vs engine size  
- Table: filtered summary of selected cars  
- Outputs update automatically when inputs change

# Conclusion

- Simple interactive exploration of mpg dataset  
- Built in Shiny with reactive elements  
- Demo link: [https://saraalyafei.shinyapps.io/mpg_shiny_app/](https://saraalyafei.shinyapps.io/mpg_shiny_app/)
